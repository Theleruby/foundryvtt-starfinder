# SFRPG
This is my personal fork of the Starfinder system definition for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, as used in roleplaying sessions at The Ruby Palace. This version is forked from a development build of [foundryvtt-starfinder](https://github.com/foundryvtt-starfinder/foundryvtt-starfinder/) somewhere in-between versions 0.26.1 and 0.27.

## Compatibility

Foundry v12. This is tested to work correctly on v12.330.

## Objectives of the fork

The official Starfinder system definition for Foundry appears to be an early alpha version. I've been finding problems with it continuously - it's extremely buggy, with large swathes of mistakes in the data and many questionable design choices.

At the time that I created this fork, the project appeared to be stagnant (it seems to be dead for months at a time, then gets a flurry of updates, then dies again). While I'm grateful for the fact that it exists, and for those who have put time into developing it over the years (THANK YOU!), I had no optimism for those issues to get fixed in any prompt amount of time. I also often have to make near-immediate fixes so that my session is actually playable, and do not have time for those fixes to be reviewed (I can't put my campaign on hold every time there's a bug, which is regularly). On top of this, I don't like to contribute directly to open-source projects, because in my experience this causes more drama than I can manage. I therefore tend to avoid this for mental health reasons.

Consequently, I elected to fork the project myself so that I could fix the most urgent problems.

Since I made this fork, the project appears to have resumed development (at least for the time being?) so the code is now outdated. When I have time, I intend to merge upstream changes in, but I'm a little busy right now, so this is a low priority for me.

### Short term objectives
* Bug fixes to the core
* Corrections to the existing content in the compendium
* Adding missing content to the compendium
* Integration of homebrew rules changes into the core (e.g. changing KAC+8 to KAC+4)
* Adding a custom weapon attack and damage roll bonus system for NPCs
* Adding hooks for my extension module, [rubicon-sfrpg](https://github.com/theleruby/rubicon-sfrpg/)

### Long term objectives
* Adding icons and artwork to most things which currently don't have any (this may end up in a private extension module to avoid copyright issues)
* Extending the system to support third-party OGL products that I own

## Current status

Development on this fork is slow. I am currently only putting in fixes required for my campaign, as I don't want to accidentally break everything and disrupt the sessions. I intend to merge upstream changes when my roleplaying group next goes on hiatus.

## Support

I don't really intend for anyone else to use this fork, and I don't plan to provide any support for it. My primary priority is just for me and my friends to play Starfinder and to have a good time. I can nevertheless be contacted via Discord (@Theleruby) if you want to discuss this fork with me.

## How to use the fork

If you really really really must adamantly use my fork instead of the official project, here's how you get it working:

* You need a Foundry-compatible version of Node.js on PATH
* Download and install version 0.26.1 of sfrpg normally
* Use your favourite git-compatible source control tool to pull down this repo
* npm install
* gulp cook
* Delete everything in systems/sfrpg and copy the files from "dist" folder into it
